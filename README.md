Timeline
========

This is a derivative work from almende/chap-links-library but not a direct clone
because of the directory structure needed for the use of xTest as JS headless
bugfree development framework. I plan to report all changes to timeline.js to
my stefanofornari/chap-links-library as a way to contribute back my changes.
If anyone has a better way to handle this, let me know :)
